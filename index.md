## üéØ Background & Project

Barcelona has a growing food-tech scene, and one company I‚Äôve known for years is **HelloFresh**. As a teenager, I learned to cook with their meal kits. At the time, my mother was busy with her studies and my dad isn‚Äôt too keen on cooking. So we opted for their subscription, I had first choice out of the three recipes that arrived each week. Back then I didn‚Äôt think much about my relationship with food, but it taught me the basics I still use today.

For this project, I wanted to explore how HelloFresh could innovate in line with today‚Äôs trends, especially **local sourcing** and **environmental impact**. While they already label some recipes as ‚Äúseasonal,‚Äù I wanted to take it further: What would it look like to analyse their recipe database and explore new possibilities for more local, plant-forward menus?

I found an online HelloFresh recipe database for every country where the company operates. For **HelloFresh Spain**, the vegetarian category alone spanned about **64 pages** (about 12 recipes per page). Direct scraping from the site proved tricky:  the platform is designed to sell recipes, not make them easy to download, to scrape the data I found this hybrid approach:
- A Python script to automatically pull all recipe links per page, massively speeding up the process.
- My Web Scraper automatically did the rest, collecting my recipes and used ingredients

After scraping and combining the CSV files, I removed duplicates, cleaned ingredient lists (stripping out units/quantities), and ended up with **236 unique vegetarian recipes** from HelloFresh Spain ready for analysis.

## üîç Key Questions

**Part 1: Descriptive statistics**
- In what months are different fruits, herbs, and vegetables in season in Spain?
- What fresh ingredients are most common in HelloFresh Spain‚Äôs vegetarian recipes? 

**Part 2: Exploring new possibilities for more local, plant-forward menus**
- What % of recipes are seasonal each month? What is the Seasonality Trend? (which months could use some love?)
- Ingredient drivers 1: Ingredients most often appear in season? And which ingredients most out of season?
- Ingredient drivers 2: Which are the ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô vegetables? Where is there a lot of potential?

## Part 1 ‚Äì Cleaning the Raw Data

</details> <details> <summary>Step 1.1 ‚Äì In what months are different fruits, herbs, and vegetables in season in Spain?</summary>

<img src="https://github.com/sjoerd-verhagen/hellofresh-seasonality-spain/blob/main/When-in-season2.png" alt="In what months are different fruits, herbs, and vegetables in season in Spain?" width="800">

This graph shows the number of fresh produce items in season throughout the year in Spain. Interestingly, summer months like **julio** and **agosto** have the fewest fresh items in season, with only 34 and 30 respectively. In contrast, oto√±o (autumn) and invierno (winter) have the most variety: **octubre** has the highest number with 58 products in season, followed by **noviembre** with 52. When looking at the averages per season, **oto√±o** has the most produce in season, followed by **invierno**, then primavera (spring), and finally verano (summer) with the least variety.

**Step overview**
In this step, I cleaned and matched ingredient names from the seasonality table with those in the recipes table, ensuring consistent formatting by lowercasing and trimming spaces. Then, I counted how many distinct recipes each ingredient appears in to find the most common ingredients. Finally, I calculated the percentage of total recipes that include each ingredient to show its relative frequency.

```sql
WITH clean_seasonality AS (
    SELECT
        LOWER(TRIM(REPLACE(producto, ' (merged)', ''))) AS producto_clean,
        month,
        in_season
    FROM public."11 aug - seasonality"
),

matched_recipes AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        LOWER(TRIM(cs.producto_clean)) AS ingredient,
        r."web-scraper-order" AS recipe_id
    FROM public."11 aug - recipes exploded" r
    JOIN clean_seasonality cs
        ON LOWER(TRIM(r."Ingredients")) = LOWER(TRIM(cs.producto_clean))
),

total_recipes AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "web-scraper-order") AS total_count
    FROM public."11 aug - recipes exploded"
)

SELECT
    mr.ingredient,
    COUNT(DISTINCT mr.recipe_id) AS unique_recipe_count,
    ROUND( (COUNT(DISTINCT mr.recipe_id)::decimal / tr.total_count) * 100, 2) AS percent_of_total_recipes
FROM matched_recipes mr
CROSS JOIN total_recipes tr
GROUP BY mr.ingredient, tr.total_count
ORDER BY unique_recipe_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| ingredient | unique_recipe_count | percent_of_total_recipes |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| cebolla    |                 118 |                      50% |
| calabac√≠n  |                  48 |                   20.34% |
| zanahoria  |                  47 |                   19.92% |
| tomate     |                  27 |                   11.44% |
| lim√≥n      |                  26 |                   11.02% |
| patata     |                  22 |                    9.32% |
| perejil    |                  22 |                    9.32% |
| lima       |                  20 |                    8.47% |
| albahaca   |                  20 |                    8.47% |
| berenjena  |                  17 |                     7.2% |

_Cebolla_ (onion) leads by a wide margin, appearing in 50% of recipes. Next are _calabac√≠n_ (zucchini) at 20.34% and _zanahoria_ (carrot) at 19.92%, showing their strong presence. _Tomate_ (tomato) and _lim√≥n_ (lemon) feature in about 11% each. Herbs also have a solid role, with _perejil_ (parsley) in 9.32% and _albahaca_ (basil) in 8.47% of recipes.
