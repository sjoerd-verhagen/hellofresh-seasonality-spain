## üéØ Background & Project

Barcelona has a growing food-tech scene, and one company I‚Äôve known for years is **HelloFresh**. As a teenager, I learned to cook with their meal kits. At the time, my mother was busy with her studies and my dad isn‚Äôt too keen on cooking. So we opted for their subscription, I had first choice out of the three recipes that arrived each week. Back then I didn‚Äôt think much about my relationship with food, but it taught me the basics I still use today.

For this project, I wanted to explore how HelloFresh could innovate in line with today‚Äôs trends, especially **local sourcing** and **environmental impact**. While they already label some recipes as ‚Äúseasonal,‚Äù I wanted to take it further: What would it look like to analyse their recipe database and explore new possibilities for more local, plant-forward menus?

I found an online HelloFresh recipe database for every country where the company operates. For **HelloFresh Spain**, the vegetarian category alone spanned about **64 pages** (about 12 recipes per page). Direct scraping from the site proved tricky:  the platform is designed to sell recipes, not make them easy to download, to scrape the data I found this hybrid approach:
- A Python script to automatically pull all recipe links per page, massively speeding up the process.
- My Web Scraper automatically did the rest, collecting my recipes and used ingredients

After scraping and combining the CSV files, I removed duplicates, cleaned ingredient lists (stripping out units/quantities), and ended up with **634 unique vegetarian recipes** from HelloFresh Spain ready for analysis.

## üîç Key Questions

**Chapter 1: Descriptive statistics**
- When are fruits,herbs and vegetables in season in Spain?

**Chapter 2: exploring new possibilities for more local, plant-forward menus**
- What % of recipes are seasonal each month? What is the Seasonality Trend?
- Ingredient drivers 1: ingredients most often appear out of season? (chance to change) 
- Ingredient drivers 2: Which are the ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô vegetables? Where is there a lot of potential?

**Step overview**
In this step, I identified the ten most frequently used fresh ingredients in HelloFresh Spain‚Äôs vegetarian recipes. I did this by cleaning the ingredient names, matching them with seasonal data, and counting how many unique recipes each ingredient appeared in.


```sql
WITH clean_seasonality AS (
    SELECT
        REPLACE(producto, ' (merged)', '') AS producto_clean,
        month,
        in_season
    FROM seasonality
)
SELECT
    LOWER(TRIM(cs.producto_clean)) AS ingredient,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r."Unique Code") AS unique_recipe_count
FROM "HelloFresh" r
JOIN clean_seasonality cs
    ON LOWER(TRIM(r."Ingredient")) = LOWER(TRIM(cs.producto_clean))
GROUP BY LOWER(TRIM(cs.producto_clean))
ORDER BY unique_recipe_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| "ingredient" | "unique_recipe_count" |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| "cebolla"    | 219                   |
| "calabac√≠n"  | 144                   |
| "zanahoria"  | 101                   |
| "lim√≥n"      | 72                    |
| "perejil"    | 67                    |
| "tomate"     | 65                    |
| "albahaca"   | 64                    |
| "puerro"     | 55                    |
| "lima"       | 49                    |
| "berenjena"  | 46                    |
