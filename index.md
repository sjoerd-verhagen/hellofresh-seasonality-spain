## TL;DR

## üéØ Background & Project

Barcelona has a growing food-tech scene, and one company I‚Äôve known for years is **HelloFresh**. As a teenager, I learned to cook with their meal kits. At the time, my mother was busy with her studies and my dad isn‚Äôt too keen on cooking. So we opted for their subscription, I had first choice out of the three recipes that arrived each week. Back then I didn‚Äôt think much about my relationship with food, but it taught me the basics I still use today.

For this project, I wanted to explore how HelloFresh could innovate in line with today‚Äôs trends, especially **local sourcing** and **environmental impact**. While they already label some recipes as ‚Äúseasonal,‚Äù I wanted to take it further: What would it look like to analyse their recipe database and explore new possibilities for more local, plant-forward menus?

I found an online HelloFresh recipe database for every country where the company operates. For **HelloFresh Spain**, the vegetarian category alone spanned about **64 pages** (about 12 recipes per page). Many of these pages were doubles, so I looked at that whilst scraping.Direct scraping from the site proved tricky:  the platform is designed to sell recipes, not make them easy to download, to scrape the data I found this hybrid approach:
- A Python script to automatically pull all recipe links per page, massively speeding up the process.
- My Web Scraper automatically did the rest, collecting my recipes and used ingredients
- Afterwards I cleaned the doubles in the data cleaning.

After scraping and combining the CSV files, I removed duplicates, cleaned ingredient lists (stripping out units/quantities), and ended up with **236 unique vegetarian recipes** from HelloFresh Spain ready for analysis.

## Part 1 ‚Äì Descriptive Statistics

</details> <details> <summary>Step 1.1 ‚Äì Produce Seasonality in Spain </summary>

**Step overview**

To understand how well HelloFresh recipes align with what is naturally available, the first step is to map out the seasonality of fresh produce in Spain. For this, I worked with _**Greenpeace‚Äôs La Gu√≠a de las Frutas y Verduras de Temporada**_ [The Seasonal Fruit and Vegetable Guide], which lists the fruits and vegetables that are in season in Spain each month. I converted the PDF into a CSV, with each row showing the product name, the month, and whether it is in season. The dataset covers **74** fresh products in total. 

<img src="https://github.com/sjoerd-verhagen/hellofresh-seasonality-spain/blob/main/Vegs Bubbles.png" width="800">

Out of these, **5** items are available year-round: ajo (garlic), cebolla (onion), patata (potato), pl√°tano (plantain), and zanahoria (carrot). The median availability is **7** months per year, with produce such as tomate (tomato), br√≥coli (broccoli), and fresas (strawberries) all falling into this middle range. In the chart above, greener and larger bubbles mark produce with longer seasonal availability, while smaller, yellower bubbles highlight those with shorter seasons.

The chart below shows how many products are in season each month. Summer months such as _julio_ (July) with **34** items and _agosto_ (August) with **30** items have the lowest variety, while _octubre_ (October) peaks with **58** items in season, followed by noviembre (November) with **52**. By season, _oto√±o_ (autumn) has the highest variety, then _invierno_ (winter), followed by _primavera_ (spring). _Verano_ (summer) has the fewest options.

</details> <details> <summary>Step 1.2 ‚Äì What fresh ingredients are most common in HelloFresh Spain‚Äôs vegetarian recipes?</summary>


**Step overview**

After mapping Spain‚Äôs produce seasonality, the next step is to see which fresh ingredients HelloFresh uses most often in its vegetarian recipes. I cleaned and matched ingredient names from the seasonality table with those in the recipes table, ensuring consistent formatting by lowercasing and trimming spaces. Then, I counted how many distinct recipes each ingredient appears in to find the most common ingredients. Finally, I calculated the percentage of total recipes that include each ingredient to show its relative frequency.


```sql
WITH clean_seasonality AS (
    SELECT
        LOWER(TRIM(REPLACE(producto, ' (merged)', ''))) AS producto_clean,
        month,
        in_season
    FROM public."11 aug - seasonality"
),

matched_recipes AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        LOWER(TRIM(cs.producto_clean)) AS ingredient,
        r."web-scraper-order" AS recipe_id
    FROM public."11 aug - recipes exploded" r
    JOIN clean_seasonality cs
        ON LOWER(TRIM(r."Ingredients")) = LOWER(TRIM(cs.producto_clean))
),

total_recipes AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "web-scraper-order") AS total_count
    FROM public."11 aug - recipes exploded"
)

SELECT
    mr.ingredient,
    COUNT(DISTINCT mr.recipe_id) AS unique_recipe_count,
    ROUND( (COUNT(DISTINCT mr.recipe_id)::decimal / tr.total_count) * 100, 2) AS percent_of_total_recipes
FROM matched_recipes mr
CROSS JOIN total_recipes tr
GROUP BY mr.ingredient, tr.total_count
ORDER BY unique_recipe_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| ingredient | unique_recipe_count | percent_of_total_recipes |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| cebolla    |                 118 |                      50% |
| calabac√≠n  |                  48 |                   20.34% |
| zanahoria  |                  47 |                   19.92% |
| tomate     |                  27 |                   11.44% |
| lim√≥n      |                  26 |                   11.02% |
| patata     |                  22 |                    9.32% |
| perejil    |                  22 |                    9.32% |
| lima       |                  20 |                    8.47% |
| albahaca   |                  20 |                    8.47% |
| berenjena  |                  17 |                     7.2% |

_Cebolla_ (onion) leads by a wide margin, appearing in 50% of recipes. Next are _calabac√≠n_ (zucchini) at 20.34% and _zanahoria_ (carrot) at 19.92%, showing their strong presence. _Tomate_ (tomato) and _lim√≥n_ (lemon) feature in about 11% each. Herbs also have a solid role, with _perejil_ (parsley) in 9.32% and _albahaca_ (basil) in 8.47% of recipes.

  <summary>Step 2.1 - How seasonal are HelloFresh recipes each month? Tracking trends and spotting low-season months </summary


**Step overview**

With the seasonality map complete and the most common ingredients identified, the next step is to measure how closely HelloFresh recipes follow the seasonal calendar. This step calculates the percentage of in-season ingredients in HelloFresh recipes for each month by matching every fresh ingredient with the seasonality table to see if it is in season at that time.

It calculates both:
- the overall monthly percentage of in-season ingredients across all recipes
- the average percentage of in-season ingredients per recipe

The output shows, per month, total fresh ingredient mentions, how many are in season, the overall percentage in season, and the recipe level average percentage in season.

**ADD GRAPH** "What % of recipes are seasonal in each month"

Winter has the lowest share of seasonal ingredients in recipes, with spring and summer only slightly higher. Autumn stands out, with 89.51% of recipe ingredients in season. On the monthly level, March is the lowest at 62.92%, followed by January, February, and April, all between 69% and 70%. A similar dip appears in summer, with July and August both around 71%.

When we compare this to the actual availability of fresh produce (see graph), we can spot months where many items are in season but are not reflected in the recipes. This is most striking in winter, where average recipe freshness is about 70%, yet the number of produce items in season is higher. This gap suggests clear potential to use more seasonal ingredients during that period.

<details>
  <summary>Step 2.2 ‚Äì Ingredient Bias: Spotting Overused and Underused Ingredients </summary


**Step overview**

In this step,  I used a _freshness index_ to compare how often ingredients appear in recipes with how often they are actually in season. By plotting the percentage of the year they‚Äôre fresh against their usage percentage, we can see clear patterns. I removed one outlier, onion, which is always in season and covers 50% of recipes.

**Overused** ‚Äì Ingredients used frequently but not in season for much of the year.
For example, _calabac√≠n_ (courgette) appears in 20% of recipes but is only in season for half the year. _Tomato_ is fresh seven months per year yet is a regular feature. Others with a high freshness gap include _albahaca_ (basil), _lima_ (lime), and _berenjena_ (aubergine) ‚Äì each used 7‚Äì8% of the time but only in season for four to six months.

**Underused despite high availability** ‚Äì Ingredients that are in season most of the year but rarely used.
Some, like _ajo_ (garlic), _patata_ (potato), and _zanahoria_ (carrot), are fresh year-round and used often. But others are surprisingly underrepresented, such as _pack choi_ (in season 10 months but only used in one recipe) and _r√°bano_ (radish, in season 9 months, also just one recipe). 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2.3 ‚Äì Which are the ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô vegetables? Where is there a lot of potential? </summary

**Step overview**
In this step...

‚ÄòForgotten‚Äô vegetables are those that do not appear at all in this batch of recipes. This could be because they are less familiar to people and harder to market as easy, tasty meals. One way to define forgotten is simply ‚Äònever used,‚Äô while frequently used vegetables are the well-known, common ones. But for our purposes, a more interesting perspective is to focus on vegetables that are currently used, yet underused, especially considering their seasonality. These have the advantage that HelloFresh already has suppliers for them, making them a quick win and an opportunity to promote as ‚Äòin season.‚Äô


</details> <details>
  <summary>Step 2.4 ‚Äì Low hanging fruit </summary
</details>

Taking these insights together, a useful approach is to focus on produce that is already used, so it is familiar to the public and suppliers are available, but could appear in more recipes. This is especially relevant for **winter**, where we saw the lowest average freshness at **70%**. On average, more produce is in season than is actually reflected in the recipes, highlighting an opportunity to make better use of what is available. In total, there are **44** fresh produce items in season during this period.

The reason for the low seasonality in winter is that for the top 10 products (not including onion) calabacin (courgete) is out of season, and tomate (tomato), lime is only 1 month in season in winter, and also albahaca and berenjena are out of season. For hearthy  wintery dishes it would be good to look at vegetables that are in season the whole winter, think of califlor, calabaza, pack choi, rabano, remolacha. These are in the lowest teir of usage but are in season throughout the winter.
